## ECO4Reward

Green Deeds, Bright Rewards: Cultivate a Greener World, One Action at a Time!. <br/>

## Project Description

ECO4Reward is a decentralized solution, generously rewarding users for actively contributing to a positive environmental impact. This innovative application tackles two critical challenges: environmental degradation and rising unemployment. In the face of Nigeria's economic struggles, a significant portion of the population is grappling with deep poverty, exacerbated by an oversaturated job market unable to accommodate the influx of university graduates. Simultaneously, environmental neglect is worsening, with a pervasive lack of awareness about the repercussions of individual actions on the environment.
</br></br>
ECO4Reward aspires to bridge these gaps by incentivizing eco-friendly actions. By doing so, it not only addresses the immediate concerns of environmental deterioration but also provides a means of livelihood for individuals in need. The synergy between environmental well-being and economic empowerment is at the heart of ECO4Reward, striving for a harmonious balance between prosperity and planet Earth.

## How it Works

Users need to create an environmental action, there are 3 types of environmental actions, general environmental action, waste recycling, and tree planting. The first one is general and it consists of various environmental actions like reducing water usage, energy conservation, and sustainable transportation, the second one focuses on waste recycling and the last one is tree planting.
</br></br>
There are two type of users in this application, the normal user and the admin, the normal users are the ones that create the environmental actions. The admin are the ones that check the submitted actions and can approved the request and assign points or reject the request if it is not convicing enough.
</br></br>
The waste recyling action requires physical submission of the waste to be recycled and the locations od submission are on the web application. Without the physical submission of the wate the action will not be approved and point will not be assigned to the user.
</br></br>
The tree planting actions requires the submission of the location of the trees planted and the tree planted will be confirmed before the action is approved and point are assigned.
</br></br>
Points are assigned for approved environmental actions and users can convert their point to toro coins, this is how users get rewarded for their environmental actions.

## SDGs Impact

The solution outlined above aligns with several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Specifically, it contributes to the following SDGs: <br/><br/>

SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation - By encouraging reduced water usage and responsible waste disposal. <br/>

SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy - Through efforts to minimize energy consumption.<br/>

SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities - By promoting sustainable practices within communities.<br/>

SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production - By advocating for reduced energy and water consumption, as well as waste recycling.<br/>

SDG 13: Climate Action - Particularly through initiatives like tree planting, which helps mitigate the impact of climate change.<br/>

These goals collectively address environmental sustainability, responsible resource management, and climate resilience, contributing to a holistic approach to development.

## How to Get Funding for ECO4Reward

Eco4Reward is a social good project, we will rely on getting funding from donors, government and willing indiviuals, that is why we have a call to action on the page for those who are willing to help fund the project. We will also sell sorted waste to companies who can use them to make new products, also through our tree planting actions, we can sell carbon credits on the global marketplace.

### Originality

- This is an original work by me. The project smart contract was built on the toronet blockchain and the frontend was built using nextjs, ethers and other javascript libraries.
